Rough Outine

Goal: Create an AI program that predicts races from training aspects OR IMPROVE UPON OTHER RACE PREDICTORS
(Mileage: maybe more mileage is better for longer races/more consistent is better/shorter distances work better off of lower milage, 
Workout paces, sleep, anthropometric parameters)

Basic Idea:
- Get team Data and race performances
- Train the algorithm with 1/2 or 2/3 of data 
- Test the algorithm with the rest of the data
- See how accurate the prediction is 

~Use TensorFlow API or other microsoft API--> maybe query STRAVA????

RESEARCH PROCESS:
- INtroduction-
    Find other algorithms that exist
    Other research/Background on the topic (2-3 papers)
    What is the problem???--------- (Other race predictors don't use training data, mostly use other races)
    What is your motivation for this research?------ what do I think?
    Brief results
    
 -Methodology-
    Data: what data did you use, where is the data from? How I acquired it
    Technology that i used--- tensorflow, maybe talk about AI training process
    
  -Data-
     Tensorflow stuff?? 
     What is the data??, Maybe make some sort of way to represent the data, which data was withheld and which was the test?
     
  -Results-
      What did you find?
      What data did the algorithm return? How does that compare to the actual results?
      (Maybe need a statistical analysis??)
      
  -Conclusion-
      Conclude with what your findings mean, how does it apply to real world, How does it benefit anyone?
      
      
      
AFTER PAPER IS WRITTEN:
- learn HTML/CSS/Javascript maybe
- create website to present my research, sort of like a resume
